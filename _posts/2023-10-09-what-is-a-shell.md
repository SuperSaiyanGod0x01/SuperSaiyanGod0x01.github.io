# Shell 
Given that so many servers run Linux, it is imperative to understand how to utilize the Linux shell. These are frequently employed because Linux servers are less prone to errors than Windows servers. For instance, Linux is frequently used to power web servers. Effective management of the operating system needs knowledge of and proficiency with the Shell, a crucial component of Linux. What did it look like when we initially converted from Windows to Linux?

An input/output (I/O) text-based interface between users and the computer system's kernel is offered via a Linux terminal, often known as a shell or command line. Another common name is "console," which describes a screen in text mode rather than a window. To operate the system, instructions can be entered into the terminal window.

A shell may be compared to a text-based GUI where commands are entered to carry out tasks like going to different folders, interacting with files, and getting system information, but with many more capabilities.

## Shell
The Bourne-Again Shell (BASH), which is a component of the GNU project, is the shell that Linux users use the most frequently. With the shell, we can accomplish whatever we can with the GUI. The shell provides us with a lot more opportunities to interface with programs and processes in order to obtain information more quickly. Additionally, many procedures may be readily automated with smaller or bigger scripts, which greatly simplifies manual effort.

Other shells than Bash include Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, Fish shell, and others.

## Terminal Emulators
Terminal emulation is software that simulates terminal functionality. It enables the use of text-based programs in conjunction with a graphical user interface (GUI). There are also command-line interfaces (CLI) that function as multiple terminals in a single terminal. In brief, a terminal interfaces with the shell interpreter.

Terminal emulators and multiplexers are useful terminal extensions. They offer several techniques and functionalities for working with the terminal, such as dividing the terminal into numerous windows, working in multiple directories, generating distinct workspaces, and much more.

Some example of terminal emulator are terminator and tmux.
